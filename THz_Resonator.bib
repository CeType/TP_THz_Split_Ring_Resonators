  abstract = {Photonic metamaterials are man-made materials with "lattice constants" smaller than the wavelength of light. Tailoring the properties of their functional building blocks (atoms) allows one to go beyond the possibilities of usual materials. For example, magnetic dipole moments at optical frequencies (mune1) become possible. This aspect substantially enriches the possibilities of optics and photonics and forms the basis for the so-called negative-index metamaterials. Here, we describe the underlying physics and review the recent progress in this rapidly emerging field},

  abstract = {Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a powerful technique for material's characterization and process control. It has been used for contact-free conductivity measurements of metals, semiconductors, 2D materials, and superconductors. Furthermore, THz-TDS has been used to identify chemical components such as amino acids, peptides, pharmaceuticals, and explosives, which makes it particularly valuable for fundamental science, security, and medical applications. This tutorial is intended for a reader completely new to the field of THz-TDS and presents a basic understanding of THz-TDS. Hundreds of articles and many books can be consulted after reading this tutorial. We explore the basic concepts of TDS and discuss the relationship between temporal and frequency domain information. We illustrate how THz radiation can be generated and detected, and we discuss common noise sources and limitations for THz-TDS. This tutorial concludes by discussing some common experimental scenarios and explains how THz-TDS measurements can be used to identify materials, determine complex refractive indices (phase delay and absorption), and extract conductivity.},
